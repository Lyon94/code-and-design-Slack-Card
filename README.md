# Slack Card

### Slack is a popular chat platform.

A Slack channel usually shows a list of names and their messages. If you click on someone's name, you'll see a card pop up that looks something like the one on the link below.

### Here are some things to consider fixing:



1) The buttons are very blocky. Change the CSS so that they have rounded corners of 4px.

2) There seems to be a typo in the top part of the card. I don't know what a **Stufent** is, but that's probably not the word you want.

3) The font for the buttons doesn't match the rest of the card. Find a way to make the font the same.

4) We've provided a placeholder image (in svg format) for you. Set the placeholder as the background for the top of the card.

5) Change the cursor to be a hand pointer instead of an arrow over the buttons.

6) Display time on real-time.

    **Hint:** Use JavaScript.

7) Commit regularly as you develop your Card. And push to GitHub when you finish with the Project.

8) Use README to explain to US how you went about the project. Be creative and detailed in your explanation.

9) Have other ideas for how to change the card? Try them out! This is your workspace!

**Note:** 
*You'll need to do some research for this quiz. There are at least two new CSS properties that you'll need to look up.*

*The buttons at the bottom of the page have the class **profile-action**.*

*Your JavaScript should be in an external file. Host GitHub Repo in GitHub pages.*

#### **To Submit, host project on GitHub. Share both link to GitHub repo and Github page in the *Web Track* slack channel.**


<!-- My work flow process -->
After following the preliminary instructions from slack, I forked the project on github and cloned it to my local machine.

I read through the README file to understand the instructions and then set off to work after taking a look at the initial project set up and final project set up pictures. This is to facilitate give me a picture of what to do to get the expected final project look.

I created a container div in the HTML file and then adjusted the top and left margin to enable me a good view of what I'm doing.

I changed and added what needed to be added as regards the instructions from the README. Since there was not much javascript code needed for the project at the moment, I added the Javascript code in the body tag before the closing body tag. 

Finally, I made a push to github and then github page to enable others have a look at the project.
