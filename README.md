# Slack Card

### Slack is a popular chat platform.

A Slack channel usually shows a list of names and their messages. If you click on someone's name, you'll see a card pop up that looks something like the one on the link below.

### Here are some things to consider fixing:



1) The buttons are very blocky. Change the CSS so that they have rounded corners of 4px.

2) There seems to be a typo in the top part of the card. I don't know what a **Stufent** is, but that's probably not the word you want.

3) The font for the buttons doesn't match the rest of the card. Find a way to make the font the same.

4) We've provided a placeholder image (in svg format) for you. Set the placeholder as the background for the top of the card.

5) Change the cursor to be a hand pointer instead of an arrow over the buttons.

6) Display time on real-time.

    **Hint:** Use JavaScript.

7) Commit regularly as you develop your Card. And push to GitHub when you finish with the Project.

8) Use README to explain to US how you went about the project. Be creative and detailed in your explanation.

9) Have other ideas for how to change the card? Try them out! This is your workspace!

**Note:** 
*You'll need to do some research for this quiz. There are at least two new CSS properties that you'll need to look up.*

*The buttons at the bottom of the page have the class **profile-action**.*

*Your JavaScript should be in an external file. Host GitHub Repo in GitHub pages.*

#### **To Submit, host project on GitHub. Share both link to GitHub repo and Github page in the *Web Track* slack channel.**
